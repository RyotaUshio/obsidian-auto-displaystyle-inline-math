# Obsidian Auto-`\displaystyle` Inline Math

This is an [Obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md) plugin to automatically make all inline maths `\displaystyle`.

It also offers the **Enable**/**Disable** commands to quickly toggle `\displaystyle` with your custom hotkey or via command palette.

That's it!

## Installation

Since this plugin is still in beta, it's not on the community plugin browser yet.

But you can install the latest beta release using [BRAT](https://github.com/TfTHacker/obsidian42-brat):

1.  Install the [BRAT](obsidian://show-plugin?id=obsidian42-brat) community plugin and enable it.
2.  Go to **Options**. In the **Beta Plugin List** section, click on the **Add Beta plugin** button.
3.  Copy and paste `RyotaUshio/obsidian-auto-displaystyle-inline-math` in the pop-up prompt and click on **Add Plugin**.
4.  (Optional) Turn on **Auto-update plugins at startup** at the top of the page.
5.  Go to **Community plugins > Installed plugins**. You will find "Auto-\\displaystyle Inline Math" in the list. Click on the toggle button to enable it.
